# 22. Multi-Node Kubernetes with `zarf init`

Date: 2024-01-23

## Status

Pending

## Context

Currently today, when allowing `zarf init` to handle cluster creation, Zarf doesn't have ability to automatically or semi-automatically provision itself across multiple nodes.  The idea here would be to allow for horizontal scalability across multiple virtual or physical nodes for site reliability and automatic failover.

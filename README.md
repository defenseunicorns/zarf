Zarf simplifies the setup & administration of Kubernetes clusters, cyber systems & workloads that support DevSecOps "across the [air gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking))."

üì¶ Out of the Box Features

- Automate Kubernetes deployments in disconnected environments
- Automate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Provide HTML Dashboards for viewing SBOM output
- Deploy a new cluster while fully disconnected (using K3s)
- Deploy pre-built tar.zst package into any existing cluster (using the kubernetes context)
- Builtin logging (PLG) and seedable git repository (gitea) and docker registry
- Automatically update pod's ImagePullSecrets so resources use the NodePort (See the Zarf Agent)
- Builtin K9s Dashboard for visualizing containers and clusters
- Builtin command to find images and resources from a helm chart
- Create secure tunnel ports for deployments

üõ†Ô∏è Configurable Features

- Customizable packages variables with defaults and user prompting
- Composable packages to include multiple sub-packages/components
- Filters to select the correct architectures/operating systems for packages

Zarf was initially theorized and demonstrated in research from Naval Postgraduate School which you can read [here](https://calhoun.nps.edu/handle/10945/68688).

## Getting Started

To try Zarf out for yourself, visit the ["Try It Now"](https://zarf.dev/install) section on our website, and if you want to learn more about Zarf and its use cases visit [docs.zarf.dev](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/zarf-overview).

From the docs you can learn more about [installation](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/operator-manual/set-up-and-install), [using the CLI](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/user-guide/the-zarf-cli/), [making packages](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/user-guide/zarf-packages/), and the [Zarf package schema](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/user-guide/zarf-schema).

## Developing

To contribute, please see our [Contributor Guide](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/developer-guide/contributor-guide).  Below is an architectural diagram showing the basics of how Zarf functions which you can read more about [here](https://docs.zarf.dev/docs/developer-guide/nerd-notes).

## Developer Workflow

Continuous Delivery is core to our development philosophy. Check out [https://minimumcd.org](https://minimumcd.org/) for a good baseline agreement on what that means.

Specifically:

- We do trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches that originate from the trunk, get merged to the trunk, and are deleted after the merge
- We perform automated testing on all changes before they get merged to the trunk

## Linux Commands

```bash
# To install Zarf
brew tap defenseunicorns/tap && brew install zarf

# Next, you will need a Kubernetes cluster. This example uses KIND.
brew install kind && kind delete cluster && kind create cluster

# Then, you will need to deploy the Zarf Init Package
zarf init

# You are ready to deploy any Zarf Package, try out our Retro Arcade!!
zarf package deploy oci://defenseunicorns/dos-games:1.0.0-$(uname -m) --key=https://zarf.dev/cosign.pub
```

:::note

This example shows how to install Zarf with the official (üìú) `defenseunicorns` Homebrew tap, however there are many other options to install Zarf on Linux such as:

# zarf tools registry push
<!-- Auto-generated by docs/gen-cli-docs.sh -->

Push local image contents to a remote registry

## Synopsis

If the PATH is a directory, it will be read as an OCI image layout. Otherwise, PATH is assumed to be a docker-style tarball.

```
zarf tools registry push PATH IMAGE [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help                help for push
      --image-refs string   path to file where a list of the published image references will be written
      --index               push a collection of images as a single index, currently required if PATH contains multiple images
```

## Options inherited from parent commands

      --allow-nondistributable-artifacts   Allow pushing non-distributable (foreign) layers
      --insecure                           Allow image references to be fetched without TLS
      --platform string                    Specifies the platform in the form os/arch[/variant][:osversion] (e.g. linux/amd64). (default "all")
  -v, --verbose                            Enable debug logs

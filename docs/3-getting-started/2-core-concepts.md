# Core Concepts

Now, assuming you're familiar with Kubernetes, AirGap, and GitOps from [Understanding the Basics](../3-getting-started/1-understand-the-basics.md), we can get started on the core concepts of Zarf.

## Zarf Concepts

- [**Zarf Package**](./4-user-guide/2-zarf-packages/1-zarf-packages.md) - A binary file that contains the instructions and dependencies necessary to install an application on a system.
- [**Zarf Component**](./4-user-guide/2-zarf-packages/2-zarf-components.md) - A set of defined functionality and resources that build up a package.
- [**Zarf Init Package**](./4-user-guide/2-zarf-packages/3-the-zarf-init-package.md) - The initial package that lays the groundwork for other packages.

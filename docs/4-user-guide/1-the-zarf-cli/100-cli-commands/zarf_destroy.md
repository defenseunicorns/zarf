## zarf destroy

Tear it all down, we'll miss you Zarf...

### Synopsis

Tear down Zarf.

Deletes everything in the 'zarf' namespace within your connected k8s cluster.

If Zarf deployed your k8s cluster, this command will also tear your cluster down bysearching through /opt/zarf for any scripts that start with 'zarf-clean-' and executing them. Since this is a cleanup operation, Zarf will not stop the teardown if one of the scripts produce an error.

If Zarf did not deploy your k8s cluster, this command will delete the Zarf namespace, delete secrets and labels that only Zarf cares about, and optionally uninstall components that Zarf deployed onto the cluster. Since this is a cleanup operation, Zarf will not stop the uninstalls if one of the resources produce an error while being deleted.

```

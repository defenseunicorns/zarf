      RKE2, also known as RKE Government, is Rancher's next-generation Kubernetes distribution.
      It is a fully conformant Kubernetes distribution that focuses on security and compliance within the U.S. Federal Government sector.
      To meet these goals, RKE2 does the following:
      Provides defaults and configuration options that allow clusters to pass the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark v1.6 with minimal operator intervention
      Enables FIPS 140-2 compliance
      Regularly scans components for CVEs using trivy in our build pipeline

## Types of Zarf Packages

There are two types of Zarf Packages, the `ZarfInitConfig` and the `ZarfPackageConfig`, which are distinguished by the `kind:` field and specified in the `zarf.yaml` file.

Throughout the rest of the documentation, we will refer to the `ZarfInitConfig` as an `init config` package or `init` package, and to the `ZarfPackageConfig` as simply a "package".

### ZarfInitConfig

The init package is used to initialize a cluster, making it ready for deployment of other Zarf Packages. It must be executed once on each cluster that you want to deploy another package onto, even if multiple clusters share the same host. For additional information on the init package, we provide detailed documentation on the Zarf ['init' package page](/ref/init-package/).

If there is no running cluster, the init package can be used to create one. It has a deployable K3s cluster component that can be optionally deployed onto your machine. To install a Kubernetes distribution other than k3s, finding or creating a custom Zarf package is necessary. When deploying a custom distribution package, the distribution package should be deployed first, followed by the init package, and then any additional packages.

:::tip

Check out the [k3s cluster](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/blob/main/packages/distros/k3s/zarf.yaml) portion of the init package to see an example of a Zarf package that installs a kubernetes distribution

:::

During the initialization process, Zarf will seed your cluster with a container registry to store images that other packages may require. Additionally, the init package has the option to deploy other features to your cluster, such as a Git server to manage your repositories or a PLG logging stack that allows you to monitor the applications running on your cluster.

#### Using the init-package

To initialize your cluster, you need to run the command `zarf init`. This command will search for a file with the specific naming convention: `zarf-init-{ARCHITECTURE}-{VERSION}.tar.zst`. The architecture must match that of the cluster you are deploying to. If you are deploying to a cluster with a different architecture, you will need to specify the name of the architecture you are deploying on with the `-a` flag. For example, if you are on an arm64 machine but are deploying on an amd64 machine, you will run `zarf init -a amd64`.

Init packages can also be run with `zarf package deploy zarf-init-{ARCHITECTURE}-{VERSION}.tar.zst`.

You do not need to create init configs by yourself unless you want to customize how your cluster is installed/configured. For example, if you want to use the init process to install a specifically configured K3s cluster onto your host machine, you can create a specific package to do that before running the init package.

### ZarfPackageConfig

`ZarfPackageConfig` refers to any package that is not an init package and is used to define specific capabilities that you want to deploy onto your initialized cluster.

To deploy a Zarf Package, you can use the command `zarf package deploy`. This will prompt you to select from all of the files in your current directory that match the name `zarf-package-*.tar.zst`. Alternatively, if you already know which package you want to deploy, you can simply use the command `zarf package deploy {PACKAGE_NAME}`.

During the deployment process, Zarf will leverage the infrastructure created during the 'init' process (such as the Docker registry and Git server) to push all the necessary images and repositories required for the package to operate.


### Package Templates

:::caution

`zarf package create` templates only template `###ZARF_PKG_TMPL_*###` entries the `zarf.yaml` file while `zarf package deploy` only templates other `manifests`, `charts`, `files`, and `actions`.  To learn more about using deployment values see the [Deployment Values](/ref/values) page.

:::

You can also specify `zarf.yaml` package configuration templates at package create time by including `###_ZARF_PKG_TMPL_*###` as the value for any string-type data in your package definition. These values are discovered during `zarf package create` and will always be prompted for if not using `--confirm` or `--set`. An example of this is below:

```yaml
kind: ZarfPackageConfig
metadata:
  name: 'pkg-variables'
  description: 'Prompt for a variables during package create'

constants:
  - name: PROMPT_IMAGE
    value: '###ZARF_PKG_TMPL_PROMPT_ON_CREATE###'

components:
  - name: zarf-prompt-image
    required: true
    images:
      - '###ZARF_PKG_TMPL_PROMPT_ON_CREATE###'
```

:::caution

It is not recommended to use package configuration templates for any `sensitive` data as this will be baked into the package as plain text.  Please use a deploy-time variable with the `sensitive` key set instead.

:::

:::note

You can only template string values in this way as non-string values will not marshal/unmarshal properly through the yaml.

Additionally, you cannot template the component import path using package configuration templates

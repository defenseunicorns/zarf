        # NOTE: We want to test providing a cluster to the test framework so this one creates its own KinD cluster
        #       rather than having the test suite do it. The K3d tests do a self-provisioned cluster and the K3s tests
        #       use Zarf to create the cluster. In this test a single cluster will be used throughout the test run.

# Zarf Examples

The Zarf examples demonstrate different ways to utility Zarf in your environment.  All of these examples follow the same general release pattern and assume an offline / air-gapped deployment target.  

To test create a virtual area to test all examples, you can run `make all` or `make vm-init` if you've already run the examples before. Run `make vm-destroy` to clean up.

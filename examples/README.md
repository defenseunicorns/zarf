# Zarf Examples

The Zarf examples demonstrate different ways to utilize Zarf in your environment.  All of these examples follow the same general release pattern and assume an offline / air-gapped deployment target. 

To test create a virtual area to test all examples, you can run `make all` or `make vm-init` if you've already run the examples before. Run `make vm-destroy` to clean up.

> **NOTE**: Examples are not meant for production use, they exist to demonstrate how to use Zarf in various ways.  Also, examples utilize software pulled from multiple sources and _some_ of them require authenticated access. Check the examples themselves for the specific accounts / logins required.

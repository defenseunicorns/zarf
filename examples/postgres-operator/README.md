# Postgres Operator

This example demonstrates deploying a performant and highly available PostgreSQL database to a Zarf airgap cluster. It uses Zalando's [postgres-operator](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator) and provides the Postgres Operator UI and a deployment of PGAdmin for demo purposes.

:::note

This example uses Zalando's Postgres operator as after looking at several alternatives, this felt like the best choice. Other tools that were close runners-up were the postgres-operator by [CrunchyData](https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator) and [KubeDB](https://github.com/kubedb/operator).

:::

## Prerequisites

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Other container engines will likely work as well but aren't actively tested by the Zarf team.

2. Install [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind). Other Kubernetes distros will work as well, but we'll be using Kind for this example since it is easy and tested frequently and thoroughly.

3. Clone the Zarf project: for the example configuration files.

4. Build the package using `zarf package create examples/postgres-operator`

5. Create a Zarf cluster as described in the [Initializing a Cluster Tutorial](../../docs/6-zarf-tutorials/1-initializing-a-k8s-cluster.md/)

## Instructions

### Deploy the package

Run the following commands to deploy the created package to the cluster

``` bash
# Open the directory
cd examples/postgres-operator

# Build the package
zarf package create

# Deploy the package (Press TAB for the listing of available packages)
zarf package deploy
```

Wait a couple of minutes. You'll know it is done when Zarf exits and you get the 3 connect commands.

### Create the backups bucket in MinIO (TODO: Figure out how to create the bucket automatically)

1. Run `zarf connect minio` to navigate to the web console.
1. Log in - Username: `minio` - Password: `minio123`
1. Buckets -> Create Bucket
   - Bucket Name: `postgres-operator-backups`

### Open the UI

The Postgres Operator UI will be available by running `./zarf connect postgres-operator-ui` and `pgadmin` will be available by running `./zarf connect pgadmin`

:::note

If you want to run other commands after/during the browsing of the postgres tools, you can add a `&` character at the end of the connect command to run the command in the background ie) `./zarf connect pgadmin &`.

### Set up a server in PGAdmin

- General // Name: `acid-zarf-test`
- General // Server group: `Servers`
- Connection // Host: (the URL in the table below)
- Connection // Port: `5432`
- Connection // Maintenance database: `postgres`
- Connection // Username: `zarf`
- Connection // Password: (run the command in the table below)
- SSL // SSL mode: `Require`

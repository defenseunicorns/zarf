# Flux Test

This example demonstrates how to use flux with Zarf to deploy the `stefanprodan/podinfo` app using GitOps.

It uses a vanilla configuration of flux with upstream containers.  For a version using Big Bang/Iron Bank see [flux-iron-bank](../../packages/flux-iron-bank/).

If you want to learn more about how Zarf handles `git` repositories, see the [git-data](../git-data/) example.

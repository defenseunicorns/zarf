## Prerequisites

Before the magic can happen you have to do a few things:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Other container engines will likely work as well but aren't actively tested by the Zarf team.

1. Install [Kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind). Other Kubernetes distros will work as well, but we'll be using Kind for this example since it is easy and tested frequently and thoroughly.

1. Clone the Zarf project for the example configuration files.

1. Build the package using `zarf package create examples/tiny-kafka`

1. Create a Zarf cluster as described in the [Initializing a Cluster Walkthrough](../../docs/13-walkthroughs/1-initializing-a-k8s-cluster.md/)

## Instructions

### Deploy the package

Run the following command to deploy the created package to the cluster

``` bash
zarf package deploy zarf-package-tiny-kafka-amd64.tar.zst --confirm
```

Wait a few seconds for the cluster to deploy the package.

### Access Kafka

Testing requires JDK and the Kafka tools: `sudo apt install openjdk-14-jdk-headless` (on Ubuntu). More details can be found at <https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart>. Steps to test:

1. Install JDK and extract the Kafka tools from the package `kafka.tgz`
2. Get the Nodeport: `NODEPORT=$(kubectl get service demo-kafka-external-bootstrap -n kafka-demo -o=jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}{"\n"}')`
3. For pub: `./bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:$NODEPORT --topic cool-topic`
4. For sub: `./bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:$NODEPORT --topic cool-topic`

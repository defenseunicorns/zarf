# Zarf Game Example - Doom in the Cluster!

This example demonstrates using Zarf to kill time (and evil).

More specifically, you'll be running a copy of the 1993, mega-hit video game _**Doom**_ in a Zarf-enabled Kubernetes (k8s) cluster&mdash;_right on your local machine_.

> _**Note**_
>
> In this example there is no "GitOps" service&mdash;Zarf is only showing off it's ability to act as a standard means of packaging, distribution, and runtime.

&nbsp;


## The Flow


Here's what you'll do in this example:

1. [Get ready](#get-ready)

1. [Create a cluster](#create-a-cluster)

1. [Package the game](#package-the-game)

1. [Deploy it](#deploy-it)

1. [Space marine the demon invasion!](#space-marine-the-demon-invasion)

1. [Cleanup](#cleanup)

&nbsp;


## Get ready


Before the magic can happen you have to do a few things:

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Other container engines will likely work as well but aren't actively tested by the Zarf team.

1. Install [KinD](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind). Other Kubernetes distros will work as well, but we'll be using KinD for this example since it is easy and tested frequently and thoroughly.

1. Clone the Zarf project &mdash; for the example configuration files.

1. Download a Zarf release &mdash; you need a binary _**and**_ an init package, [here](../../docs/workstation.md#just-gimmie-zarf).

1. (Optional) Log `zarf` into Iron Bank if you haven't already &mdash; instructions [here](../../docs/ironbank.md#2-configure-zarf-the-use-em). Optional for this specific example since the container comes from GitHub rather than Iron Bank but a good practice and needed for most of the other examples.

1. (Optional) Put `zarf` on your path &mdash; _technically_ optional but makes running commands simpler. Make sure you are picking the right binary that matches your system architecture. `zarf` for x86 Linux, `zarf-mac-intel` for x86 MacOS, `zarf-mac-apple` for M1 MacOS.

&nbsp;


## Create a cluster

You can't run software without _somewhere to run it_, so the first thing to do is create a local Kubernetes cluster that Zarf can deploy to. In this example we'll be using KinD to create a lightweight, local K8s cluster running in Docker.

Kick that off by running this command:

```sh
kind create cluster
```

This will result in a single-node Kubernetes cluster called `kind-kind` on your local machine running in Docker. Your KUBECONFIG should be automatically configured to talk to the new cluster.

```sh
cd <same dir as zarf-init.tar.zst>
zarf init
```

Follow the prompts, answering "no" to each of the optional components, since we don't need them for this deployment.

Congratulations!  Your machine is now running a single-node Kubernetes cluster powered by Zarf!

 > _**Note**_
 >
 > Zarf supports non-interactive installs too! Give `zarf init --confirm --components logging` a try next time.

**Troubleshooting:**

> _**ERROR:  Unable to find the package on the local system, expected package at zarf-init.tar.zst**_
>
> The zarf binary needs an init package to know how to setup your cluster! So, if `zarf init` returns an error like this:
> ```sh
> ERROR:  Unable to find the package on the local system, expected package at zarf-init.tar.zst
> ```
> It's likely you've either forgotten to download `zarf-init.tar.zst` (as part of [getting ready](#get-ready)) _**OR**_ you are _not_ running `zarf init` from the directory the init package is sitting in.

> _**ERROR: failed to create cluster: node(s) already exist for a cluster with the name "kind"**_
>
> You already have a KinD cluster running. Either just move on to use the current cluster, or run `kind delete cluster`, then `kind create cluster`.

> _**Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?**_
>
> Docker isn't running or you're otherwise not able to talk to it. Check your Docker installation, then try again.

## Package the game


Zarf is (at heart) a tool for making it easy to get software from _where you have it_ to _**where you need it**_&mdash;specifically, across an airgap. Since moving bits is so core to Zarf the idea of a "ready-to-move group of software" has a specific name&mdash;the _package_.

All of the software a Zarf cluster runs is installed via package&mdash;for many reasons like versioning, auditability, etc&mdash;which means that if you want to run _**Doom**_ in your cluster you're going to have to build a package for it.

Luckily, this is very easy to do&mdash;package contents are defined by simple, declarative yaml files and _we've already made one for you_. To build the game package you simply:

```sh
cd <zarf dir>/examples/game     # directory with zarf.yaml, and
zarf package create --confirm   # make the package
```

Watch the terminal scroll for a while. Once things are downloaded & zipped up and you'll see a file ending in `.tar.zst` drop.  _That's_ your package.

&nbsp;


## Deploy it


It's time to feed the package you built into your cluster.

> _**Note**_
>
> If you were an evil genius trying to get _**Doom**_ to run in your internet-isolated, evil underground super-base _this_ is where you would burn the zarf release + game package to removable media for shipment "across the airgap"... probably via evil FedEx.

Since you're running a Zarf cluster directly on your local machine&mdash;where the game package & `zarf` binary _already are_&mdash;deploying the game is very simple:

```sh
zarf package deploy ./zarf-package-appliance-demo-multi-games.tar.zst --confirm
```

In a couple seconds the cluster will have loaded your package.

&nbsp;

## Space marine the demon invasion!

After the deploy has completed, a prompt would have displayed the new connect commands you can use to connect automatically bring up the game in your browser. Running the command `zarf connect games` should open your browser to `http://localhost:<SOME_PORT>` and be greeted by a short catalog of games to play. Run `zarf connect doom` to directly open the _**Doom**_ game. We use `zarf connect` here so we can connect to it in a browser without needing a Kubernetes Ingress Controller, which is a more advanced topic and has different configurations depending on which controller and which distribution of Kubernetes you are using.

Once you see the ultra-iconic title screen, you're ready to go (save the world)!

## Cleanup


Once you've had your fun it's time to clean up.

In this case, since the Zarf cluster was installed specifically (and _only_) to serve this example, clean up is really easy&mdash;you just tear down the entire cluster:

```sh
kind delete cluster
```

It only takes a couple moments for the _entire cluster_ to disappear&mdash;long-running system services and all&mdash;leaving your machine ready for the next adventure.

## Zarf Game Mode Example

This example demonstrates using Zarf to kill time (and evil).  In this mode there is no utility cluster and Zarf is simple a standard means of wrapping airgap concerns for K3s.  Game mode is identical to [Appliance Mode](../appliance/README.md), but more fun.  Just follow the [steps](../appliance/README.md#steps-to-use) listed there in this folder and have fun.

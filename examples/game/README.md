## Zarf Game Mode Example

This example demonstrates using Zarf to kill time (and evil).  In this mode there is no gitops service and Zarf is simply a standard means of wrapping airgap concerns for K3s.  Game mode is identical to [Appliance Mode](../appliance/README.md), but more fun.

### Steps to use:
1. Create a Zarf cluster as outlined in the main [README](../../README.md#2-create-the-zarf-cluster)
2. Follow [step 3](../../README.md#3-add-resources-to-the-zarf-cluster) using this config in this folder

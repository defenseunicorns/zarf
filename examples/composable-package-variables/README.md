# Zarf Composable Packages (w/Variables) Example

This example demonstrates using Zarf to compose existing zarf packages into another package using variables to determining the package to import.

> _**Note**_
>
> This is mostly a proof of concept example simply to test the variables system, but could be useful to build pseudo-packages that can select components with overrides of intermediate packages.
